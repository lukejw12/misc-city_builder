Names?
Card Craft 7/10
(more to be determined)
honestly have no idea where im going with this soo :shrug:
(most of these ideas are inspired by games i like so uhh yeah)
Ideas
(I KNOW THERE ARE TYPOS )
1. Card Styled City Builder / Resource Management (essentially Stacklands but minecraft)
    a. Cards placed on board.
    b. Cards can stack.
    c. Player manages their cards whilst producing materials and resources
    d. Goal is to beat 5 Major Bosses, Mega Slime, Mutated Hoglin, Elder Guardian, Wither, Ender Dragon
    e. Fight system is turn based with health, damage, and skill types managed with custom cards
    f. City builderr aspect plays in with villagers, requires food each day or they die,

2. Simplistic Styled Resource Grinding. (similar to Forager)
    a. Cards placed on board
    b. player controls manequinn npc that can attack trees and other resources thats on its base island
    c. some kind of quest system or entity which demands a specific amouunt of resourrces by the end of a time period.
    If resources are met then the player is rewarded with some king of coin or gem which can be used to buy stuff from a marrket structure and purchase land,
    if they fail to meet the req then some kind of disaster happens, ie: random structure destroyed, permmanant -1 health, entire island section gets wiped.
    d. they work towards creating some kind of laser / attack to defeat the entity, thus causing something cool to happen, maybe a second worrld or maybe a freeplay/sand box mode


PLEASE I NEED IDEAS I WILL TAKE ANYTHNG
(this is gonna be slower then my other stuff cuz i have school and worrk to balance so dont expect it to be soon)
